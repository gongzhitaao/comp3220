* Textbook

  You may need a textbook, /Concepts of Programming Languages (10th
  Edition)/ (get from [[http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Programming-Languages-10th-Edition/dp/0131395319][{{{AMAZON_LOGO}}}]]), by Robert W. Sebesta.  My
  slides are adapted from the textbook and slides from Dr. Carlisle.

* Homework

  *Homework is submitted on [[http://auburn.instructure.com/][Canvas]]*.  Late homework is penalized 40
  points no matter how late it is.  The last day to turn in late
  homework is the final exam.  The homework is accessible on the
  [[http:/comp3220/][homepage]].

* Grading

  I have a TA do all the grading.  If you have any doubts, talk to the
  TA first.  The tentitive weights for this semester are as follows.

  - Homework: 40%
  - Midterm: 20%
  - Final: 20%
  - Term Project: 20%
