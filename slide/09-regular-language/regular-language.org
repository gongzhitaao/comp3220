* Regular Language

** Defined by DFA

   For any DFA \(\mathcal{M} = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\),
   \(\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{M})\) denotes the languages accepted by
   \(\mathcal{M}\)

   \[\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{M}) = {x\in\Sigma^* \mid \delta^*(q_0, x)\in F}\]

   - Regular Language :: is one that is \(\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{M})\)
        for some DFA \(\mathcal{M}\).
