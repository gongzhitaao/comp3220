* HOWTO

  I suppose you are working on a Linux machine.  Otherwise, please
  figure out how to configure the enviroment yourself.

  Start from the project folder, build the project in console from
  scratch.

  1. Create a =build= directory.  Separate building from source code.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
mkdir build && cd build
     #+END_EXAMPLE

  2. Build the whole project with CMake.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cmake ..
     #+END_EXAMPLE

  3. Go into the =tests/= directory under =build=.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd tests
     #+END_EXAMPLE

  4. Run the test.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./test-bf
     #+END_EXAMPLE
