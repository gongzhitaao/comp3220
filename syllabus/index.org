* Textbook

  You may not need a textbook.  Everything I want to share is on this
  site.  However, most of the materials on this site are adapted from
  /Concepts of Programming Languages (10th Edition)/ (get from
  [[http://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Programming-Languages-10th-Edition/dp/0131395319][{{{AMAZON_LOGO}}}]]), by Robert W. Sebesta.

* Homework

  *Homework is submitted on [[http://auburn.instructure.com/][Canvas]]*.  Late homework is penalized 40
  points no matter how late it is.  The last day to turn in late
  homework is the final exam.

* Grading

  I have a TA do all the grading.  If you have any doubts, talk to the
  TA first.  The tentitive weights for this semester are as follows.

  - Homework: 60%
  - Midterm: 20%
  - Final: 20%
