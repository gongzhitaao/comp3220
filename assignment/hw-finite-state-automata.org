* Solve with FSA

  For question 1-4, assume alphabet is \(\Sigma = \{0, 1\}\).

  1. =C=-equivalent Boolean operators. please implement an FSA for
     each of the =C=-equivalent Boolean operators, =||= (logic =OR=),
     ~&&~ (logic =AND=) and =^= (logic =XOR=).  /Note that logic ~OR~
     and logic ~AND~ are short-circuit/.
  2. Implement an FSA that accepts strings which are /even length/.
  3. Implement an FSA that accepts /exactly/ 3 0's.
  4. Implement an FSA that accepts /at least/ 3 0's.
  5. Implement an FSA that only accepts strings which are =ART=,
     =ARTS=, =ARTIST=, or =ABLE=.  The alphabet is \(\Sigma = \{A, B,
     E, I, L, R, S, T\}\).
