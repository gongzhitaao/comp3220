#+TITLE: PPL -- Lexical & Syntax Analysis
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil
#+SETUPFILE: ../setup.org

* Motivation

  - The syntax analyzer is at the heart of compiler.
  - It is an application of grammar.
  - Lexical and syntax analyzer are used often


* Introduction

  Analyzing syntax is divided into two distinct parts.
  - lexical analysis :: small-scale language constructs, such as names
       and numeric literals.
  - syntax analysis :: large-scale constructs, such as expressions,
       statements, and program units.

** Reason for Separation

   - Simplicity for both lexical and syntax analyzer.
   - Efficiency with regard to compilation time.
   - Portability.  Separate machine dependent from machine
     independent.


* Lexical Analysis

  A lexical analyzer is essentially a pattern matcher.
