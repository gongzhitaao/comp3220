#+BEGIN_abstract
We study the sementic meaning of one of the basic element: the
variable.  Concepts of binding and scoping are especially important
for using a language.
#+END_abstract

1. (*10 points*) Dynamic type binding is closely related to implicit
   heap dynamic variables.  Explain this relationship.
2. (*40 points*) Consider the following Javascript snippets.

   #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
(function() {

    var x = -1;

    function sub1() {
        var x = 1;

        function sub2() {
            console.log(x);
            sub3();
        }

        sub2();
    }

    function sub3() {
        console.log(x);
    }

    function sub4() {
        var x = 1;
        sub3();
    }

    sub1();                     // call 1
    sub3();                     // call 2
    sub4();                     // call 3

})();
   #+END_SRC

   What the output would be of =call 1=, =call 2= and =call 3=
   respectively if

   - assuming static scoping
   - assuming dynamic scoping

3. (*20 points*) For the language C++, give as precise binding times
   as you can for the following attributes.  Explain your answer.

   - the maximum of significant digits in a real number.
   - the meaining of =char=.
   - the size of an array variable.
   - the size of an array parameter.
   - the location of a local variable.
   - the value of a constant.
   - the location of a function.

4. (*10 points*) Discuss the relative advantanges of early binding and
   late binding.
